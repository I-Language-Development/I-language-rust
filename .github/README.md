## About this project
Have you been dreaming about coding in your perfect programming language?
Have you thought about what could be possible with the best sides of different languages?
Here is the power of some of the best languages combined.

## Installing
### Download from releases
Navigate to the releases tab and select the newest release. Download the version fitting your OS and run the installer.

### Pip
To install the package via pip, run `pip install ilanguage` (The `pip` command might be called differently depending on
your OS). The installer will be executed automatically. If you use pip to install the package, you will be able to use
`python -m ilanguage ARGUMENTS` just like `ilanguage ARGUMENTS`.

### Git
To clone the repository locally using git run `git clone https://github.com/I-Language-Development/I-language.git`.

## Your first program
To make a simple hello world program follow the instructions below:
1. Create a file ending with `.ilang`.
2. Open the file and write `output("Hello world!")` to it.
3. Open the path of the file in your terminal and type `ilanguage FILE` where `FILE` is the name of the file including
the `.ilang` file extension.
4. You should see "Hello world!" in your terminal.

That's it! It's literally so easy.
