# Installation

To install the I programming language follow the instructions below:

1. Download the newest release.
2. Double click the `installer` file. Depending on your operating system it will end with either `.exe` (Windows) or no ending (Linux).
3. Configure the installation with the GUI.
4. After restarting, you should be able to execute `.il` files. You can check, if the installation was successful by running `il -v`. If your installation was unsuccessful, you can create a new issue [here](https://github.com/I-Language-Development/issues/new).
